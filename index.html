        <p> Many fans argue that Messi is better than Ronaldo because of his extraordinary playmaking ability, vision, and natural talent that elevate the entire team. While Ronaldo is known for his athleticism and goal-scoring power, Messi consistently creates chances out of nothing, dribbling past defenders with ease and delivering precise passes that open up the game. His style is more fluid and creative, relying on intelligence and technique rather than physicality. Messi’s ability to control the tempo of a match, link up with teammates, and produce moments of genius makes him not just a great scorer, but a complete footballer—one who can change the course of a game in countless ways.</p>
